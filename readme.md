# Number to Word Converter

This is a Python script that converts a number to its written word form.

## Usage

To use the script, simply run the Python file in your terminal or command prompt:

```
python number_to_word.py
```

The script will then prompt you to enter a number, and it will output the written word form of that number.

## Example

```
Enter a number: 123
One Hundred Twenty three
```

## Functions

The script includes the following functions:

1. `num_2_word(number)`: This function takes an integer `number` as input and returns the written word form of the number.

## Testing

The script includes a set of test cases to ensure the `num_2_word()` function is working correctly. To run the tests, simply execute the script:

```
python number_to_word.py
```

If all tests pass, the script will print "All tests passed!"

## Dependencies

This script does not have any external dependencies. It uses only built-in Python libraries and data structures.
